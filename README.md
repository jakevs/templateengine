# Template Engine - Team Builder

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/Position-Manager-green.svg)](https://github.com/jakevs/https://jakevs.github.io/templateengine/)

## Description

This application was designed for a user to generate a webpage that displays a team's basic information so that they have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles. First, I created the lib pages and got all of the tests to pass, using 'npm run test'. Put prompts into the app.js, so that the user can quickly answer questions and input information. The app will let you choose from different employment options, manager, engineer, or Intern. After all prompts are answered, an HTML page will be created and posted into the output folder. The file will show a clean webpage with all employee information.
